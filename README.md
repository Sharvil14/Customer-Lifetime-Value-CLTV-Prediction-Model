# Customer-Lifetime-Value-CLTV-Prediction-Model
Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) prediction using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. Built a Gradient Boosting Regressor with preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation. Enabled data-driven forecasting to support strategic business decisions.
# Objective & Methodology: 
This project aimed to predict the Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) of individuals for a business. Using historical data, a regression model was developed to estimate the future value of each customer. The methodology involved loading and exploring the data, followed by comprehensive preprocessing steps including one-hot encoding for categorical features, scaling for numerical features, and creating new polynomial and interaction features to capture complex relationships. A Gradient Boosting Regressor model was trained on the processed data, and its performance was evaluated using standard regression metrics.
# Key Technologies: 
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
# Outcome: 
A predictive model capable of estimating CLTV was successfully built and evaluated. The model provides a basis for understanding factors influencing customer value and forecasting future revenue from customers.
# Business Relevance: 
Accurate CLTV prediction enables businesses to make data-driven decisions regarding customer acquisition strategies, resource allocation for retention efforts, and identifying high-value customer segments for targeted engagement and personalized experiences.
# Learning: 
Through this project, practical experience was gained in the complete machine learning pipeline, from data handling and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and understanding the business implications of predictive analytics.
